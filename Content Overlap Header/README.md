##Addon: Content Overlap Header

The default theme has a header that is 196px. This addon changes the height of the header to be anything >192px. 

What it does, is it essentially 'hides' the header and uses the body of the page as a background. Your image should be 1920px wide and >192px in height. Play around with it to see what you like. 

**This addon really works best if you have an eye for design. If you don't at all, chances are you'll just make the page look worse. So be cautious!**

Some notes:  

* This addon should be used for subreddits that are very visual, such as art subreddits. If you can't think of a suitable image that would fit your subreddit theme, reconsider not using this addon.
* Darker background images work best. 
* Name it `headerimg` and upload it to the stylesheet page. 
* Keep in mind that users below a 1920px wide resolution will not see the full image, so don't display content that would be cut off (such as text) on the full width.
