#Addon: Small Header

The default theme has a header that is 196px. This addon changes the header height to 144px. 

**Make sure the header image you are using is 1920px by 144px.**

Some notes:

* Darker background images work best. 
* Name it `headerimg` and upload it to the stylesheet page. 
* Keep in mind that users below a 1920px wide resolution will not see the full image, so don't display content that would be cut off (such as text) on the full width.
