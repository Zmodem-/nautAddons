#Addon: Custom Colors

This addon allows you to easily customize all colors in the Naut theme. 

Some notes:

* Be cautious with changing the link colors! Don't use dark shades of purple, because those look like links that a user has visited already. Don't use black or gray, otherwise they don't stand out enough from regular text. Don't use colors that are too light, they strain the eyes and hurt readability.
* If you use this addon with the colored infobox addon, use the same color on the buttons as the infobox. This looks really good!
* Make the button hover color a little lighter than the button color, and the button active color a little darker for best results.
