#Addon: Custom Subreddit Title

If you have a special title image for your subreddit that would look better than just regular text, you can use this Addon. For example, /r/Google might want to use the actual Google logo. 

Some notes:

* **The image should be 42px in height** and anything <320px in width.
* Make sure that your image is completely visible and readable on your background image too. Add some drop shadows in Photoshop if it doesn't. If your title image is completely white on a light background, it's not readable. Please don't do that.
* The addon replaces both the header and sidebar title. You can also just replace either by removing one of the two blocks in the addon.
